    "The Department of Information Science and Engineering was established in the year 2000 with the vision to produce high-qualified professionals in the field of Information Technology. The department started with an intake of 60 students, and subsequently intake was increased to 120 in the year 2007, 150 in the year 2021, and 180 in the year 2022. With the support of our beloved chairman Dr. Shamanur Shivashankarappa, Director and Principal, the department has grown over the last two decades in terms of infrastructure, facilities & teaching excellence. The department has a state-of-the-art laboratory, library facilities and well-trained and experienced teaching faculty who emphasize the theoretical and practical applications of computation to the needs of society. So far, the department has produced more than 2200 successful engineering graduates who have occupied leading positions in reputed organizations all over the globe. Apart from teaching, the faculties are involved in research and development activities.<br>The department is recognized by IIT Bombay as one of the remote centre, with a mission to reach out and engage a large number of teachers to enrich their knowledge through faculty development programs. The department has set up Industry 4.0 - Center of Excellence in collaboration with Rovelabs, Bengaluru to provide in-depth technical knowledge, innovation, and research opportunities for students. The Insync forum is meant exclusively to encourage the students to explore their technical and cultural abilities. Technical seminars, pep talks by accomplished alumni, and tech talks by industry experts are organized regularly under Insync. Aarohana, a techno fest, held every year creates a platform for students to showcase their technical talents. Technical quizzes, paper presentations, coding, debugging, and designing contests are organized in the Infozest. The department could achieve success because of the kind of cooperation extended by all our stakeholders. Looking forward to climbing further steps to attain more success in the years to come."
